# CS50's Introdution to Computer Science

"Demanding, but definitely doable. Social, but educational. A focused topic, but broadly applicable skills. CS50 is the quintessential Harvard (and Yale!) course."


Hello, world! This is CS50 (aka CS50x through edX), Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
